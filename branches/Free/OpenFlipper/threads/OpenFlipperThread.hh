/** \brief Thread handling class for OpenFlipper

    Instantiate this class in order to provide a thread
    to a plugin. Unless you don't need a specialized
    run() or cancel() function, it won't be necessary to
    reimplement this class. Just connect the signals
    for the thread to work properly.
        
    Note: Updating GUI elements of the main window from
    within a thread which is not the main thread can
    cause unexpected crashes to OpenFlipper. This introduces
    some major limitations to the usage of threads
    in plugins. These include avoiding the creation
    of new objects and generally every function that
    produces logging messages.

    The class should be used along with \ref processInterfacePage

    It is not necessary to derive from this class for most operations,
    but you can.
