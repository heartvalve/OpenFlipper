/** This Macro creates a salt for your plugin which is added to the 
    license files. You have to keep this Salt 
    !!!SECRET!!!, 
    otherwise everybody can create licenses for your Plugin. The special 
    form of this macro makes the salt string invisible inside the binary 
    of the plugin so that it is not easy to recover from it.

    Modify the Salts below to create your own plugin keys. Then
    copy this file to any plugin which should use the license manager.

    Additionally add the option 

    LICENSEMANAGER 

    to your CMakeLists generator (e.g.  openflipper_plugin (LICENSEMANAGER ) )
    Additionally dont derive your Plugin from QObject but from LicenseManager
    which has to be the first one in your class definition.

    When the plugin is now build, an additional file
