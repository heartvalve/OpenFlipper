/* Salt file for security interface 
*/

/** This Macro creates a salt (basically a key) for your plugin which is added to the 
    license files. You have to keep this salt file
    !!!SECRET!!!, otherwise everybody can create licenses for your Plugin. The special 
    form of this macro makes the salt string invisible inside the binary 
    of the plugin so that it is not easy to recover from it.

    Modify the Salts below to create your own plugin keys. Then
    copy this file to your plugin directory and name it "salt.hh".

    Details on how to use license management can be found here on the \ref securityInterfacePage .
