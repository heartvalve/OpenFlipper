DIRS        = additional directories with source files
DEPS        = required dependencies for find_package macro
OPTDEPS     = optional dependencies for find_package macro, if found, define ENABLE_<Depname> will be set automatically
LDFLAGSADD  = flags added to the link command
CFLAGSADD   = flags added to the compile command
LIBRARIES   = libraries added to link command
LIBDIRS     = additional link directories
INCDIRS     = additional include directories
ADDSRC      = additional source files
INSTALLDATA = directories that will be installed into the openflipper data directory

TRANSLATION_LANGUAGES = language codes for translation
TRANSLATION_ADDFILES  = additional files that should be included into the translation files

LICENSEMANAGER = Compile plugin with license management

Plugins can implement a acg_list_filter ("listname") macro to filter out
unneeded headers, sources and ui files from the autogenerated 
build sources lists (see common.cmake drop_templates macro)

Translations
Create a subdirectory called translations in your Plugin directory
The *.ts files there will be used for the translations

Special DEPS:
CUDA: 
If your plugin requires cuda, add "CUDA" to the list of dependencies
and create a subdir called Cuda in your plugin directory
The files in this directory will be compiled by nvcc and linked
into the plugin
