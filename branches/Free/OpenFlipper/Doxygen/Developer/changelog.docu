/*! \page changelog Changelog
 *
 * - <b>OpenFlipper 1.0 RC6 ( 2010/03/17 , 8742 )</b>
 *      - <b>Core</b>
 *          - Splitted File Plugins ( Now there are type plugins loaded first to register types and the file plugins to load data)
 *          - Moved loading code from OpenMesh to file plugins to support multiple data types
 *          - Changed handling of ObjectSelectionChanged
 *          - Updated internal types handling (directly initialized by core now) 
 *          - Handle object tree integration for BaseObjects automatically (No longer necessary to call the setParent Function)
 *          - selectionChanged, visibilityChanged and objectPropertiesChanged are now handled internally. If One of these changes, the signals
 *                will be emitted by the core and passed to the plugins.
 *          - Basic implementation to copy per Object data along with copied object
 *          - Implemented drag and drop for files to OpenFlipper
 *          - Fixes for building with QT 4.6
 *          - Added a map to find objects in the objectTree (large speedup when handling multiple objects)
 *          - Internal counters for targets, sources and objects avoiding iterations across all objects ( another speedup)
 *      - <b>Plugin interface changes</b>
 *              - Changed PluginFunctions to return 0 object for identifier -1
 *              - Provide a QSettings interface to store per Plugin settings (called OpenFlipperSettings in globaloptions)
 *              - Core manages objectSelectionChanged, visibilityChanged and objectPropertiesChanged. (Do not emit these signals in your plugin anymore)
 *              - Added TypeInterface to register types from plugins (These plugins will be loaded first!)
 *              - Improvements to status bar interface (now accepts arbitrary widgets)
