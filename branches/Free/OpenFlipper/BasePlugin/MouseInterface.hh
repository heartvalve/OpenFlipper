The mouse interface can be used to receive mouse events which occur in the glViewer.

There are 4 main viewer modes:
<ul>
<li> <b>Move Mode</b> events are never passed to one of the plugins and is only used for scene navigation
inside the viewers.
<li> <b>Picking Mode</b> events where passed through the MouseInterface::slotMouseEvent() and MouseInterface::slotMouseWheelEvent().
<li> <b>Light Mode</b> events where passed through the MouseInterface::slotMouseEventLight()
<li> <b>Identify Mode</b> events where passed through the MouseInterface::slotMouseEventIdentify()
</ul>

You can add handlers for these mouse events in your plugin. Remember that all plugins receive these signals.\n

The picking mode is only a global mode which is devided into several other picking modes that can be managed
through the PickingInterface. If you react on mouse events from picking mode, you should check if the current
picking mode is yours.
\code
void MousePlugin::slotMouseEvent(QMouseEvent* _event) {

  // Check if your pick mode is currently active
  if ( PluginFunctions::pickMode() == "YourPickMode" && PluginFunctions::actionMode() == Viewer::PickingMode ) {

    // If double click has been performed
    if (_event->type() == QEvent::MouseButtonDblClick) {
      unsigned int node_idx, target_idx;
      OpenMesh::Vec3d hitPoint;

      // Get picked object's identifier by picking in scenegraph
      if ( PluginFunctions::scenegraphPick(ACG::SceneGraph::PICK_ANYTHING,_event->pos(), node_idx, target_idx, &hitPoint) ) {

        BaseObjectData* object;

        // Get picked object
        if ( PluginFunctions::getPickedObject(node_idx, object) ) {

          // Do something with the object

        }
      }
    }
  }


}
\endcode

See our tutorial \ref ex3 for an example of how to use mouse and keyboard events
within a plugin.

To use the MouseInterface:
<ul>
<li> include MouseInterface.hh in your plugins header file
<li> derive your plugin from the class MouseInterface
<li> add Q_INTERFACES(MouseInterface) to your plugin class
<li> And add the signals or slots you want to use to your plugin class (You don't need to implement all of them)
</ul>
