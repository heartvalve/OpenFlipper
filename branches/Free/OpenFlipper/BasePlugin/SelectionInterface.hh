    /** @name Registering Selection Environments and primitives
     *
     * These functions are used to register your selection environment to
     * the selection system. The environment is basically a collection of selection
     * metaphors that will be available for a set of DataTypes.
     *
     * You Register the Environment via addSelectionEnvironment(). Afterwards you can
     * register DataTypes to the previously created environment with registerType().
     * The selection interactions defined in the environment will only be available,
     * if the registered DataTypes exist.
     *
     * Each DataType can consist of different primitives (e.g. a mesh usually consists
     * of vertices edges and faces). Use addPrimitiveType() to register these
     * primitives and remember the handles you got.
     *
     * Here is a short example of how to add a new selection environment and
     * register some data type and primitive type:
     *
     * So in our plugin we first want to add a new selection environment:
     \code
     
     emit addSelectionEnvironment("Mesh Object Selections", "Select Triangle Mesh Primitives.",
                                 QIcon(someIconPath + "mesh_selection.png"), environmentHandle_);
     \endcode
     * Now, our handle to the newly created environment is in environmentHandle_.
     * We should now see a new tab widget in the selection base tool box
     * displaying our selection environment:
     *
     * \image html selectionEnvironment.png
     *
     * We now want to register a specific data type for which we want to enable
     * selection. Say DATA_TRIANGLE_MESH:
     \code
     
     emit registerType(environmentHandle_, DATA_TRIANGLE_MESH);
     
     \endcode
     *
     * Repeat this for as many data types as you want to handle in your plugin.
     * Since triangle meshes normally consist of vertex, edge and face primitives,
     * we want to enable selection for the three of them:
     \code
     
     emit addPrimitiveType(environmentHandle_, "Select Vertices", QIcon(iconPath + "vertexType.png"), vertexType_);
     emit addPrimitiveType(environmentHandle_, "Select Edges",    QIcon(iconPath + "edgeType.png"),   edgeType_);
     emit addPrimitiveType(environmentHandle_, "Select Faces",    QIcon(iconPath + "faceType.png"),   faceType_);
     
     \endcode
     *
     * The three variables of type SelectionInterface::PrimitiveType vertexType_, edgeType_ and faceType_
     * now hold the handles to the newly added primitive types. We use these to reference the types
     * later on. For each registered primitive type, we now see a button appearing in the recently
     * created environment tab in selection base plugin's tool box:
     *
     * \image html selectionPrimitives.png
     *
     * The user can now chose which primitive type she wants to select via simply clicking one of these
     * buttons (or more than one by holding the control key while clicking). We then go on with requesting
     * the available selection metaphors in the next section.

     *
     * The interactions for these metaphors are controlled by the Base Selection
     * Plugin. The results of these interactions are than passed on to the

     * These functions are used to tell the system, that you can handle the
     * given selection metaphors in your plugin.

     * You can also add your custom seletion mode via addCustomSelectionMode().
     *
     * To continue the above example, we now want to make toggle, volume lasso as well

/** \page selectionInterfacePage Selection Interface
\image html SelectionInterface.png

The SelectionInterface can be used to provide selection functions. Selection works
as follows. OpenFlipper basically contains the SelectionBasePlugin which offers
some graphical tools (such as selection sphere, lasso tools, etc.) that can be used for selecting entities.

Now each object type (poly/triangle meshes, skeletons, splines, whatever) has to implement
its own selection functionality. Say we wanted to implement selection for poly/tri mesh objects.
For this purpose we derive a plugin from SelectionInterface and create a new selection environment
via the addSelectionEnvironment() signal, naming it e.g. "Mesh Object Selection".

After having created the necessary selection environment, we have to register our specific data type,
that is tell the SelectionBase plugin which data types will be handled (selected) by our plugin.
In the example from above we would register DATA_POLY_MESH as well as DATA_TRIANGLE_MESH.
We do this by calling the signal registerType(). Now we have to determine which primitive type
should be selectable. For poly/tri meshes we would determine vertices, edges, halfedges and faces
to be selectable. This is performed via emission of the signal addPrimitiveType().

We can then choose which of the default selection tools should be available for this environment.
We could, for example, request the toggle, flood fill and the sphere selection tool by calling
the signals showToggleSelectionMode(), and so on. Additionally, it's possible to create
custom selection tools that can be completely different from the default ones.

After having requested the desired selection tools, each time a selection tool has been used,
the appropriate slot is called for further processing, that is the actual selection of the
primitives.

SelectionInterface also provides means to add operations for a specific primitive type
(such as, for example, "Clear Vertex Selection" or "Select All Vertices" for vertex selections).
We can tell SelectionBase to add there operations by emitting addSelectionOperations().
Each time an operation button has been clicked, slot slotSelectionOperation() is called.

The overall idea is to separate the UI and control elements from actual implementations
of selection functionality for a specific data type. So, in general SelectionBase manages
all UI control elements and and the rendering of the selection tools whereas the specific
type selection plugins manage the real selection of their entities as well as scripting functions.
