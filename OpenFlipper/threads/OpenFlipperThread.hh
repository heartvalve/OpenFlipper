/**
\class OpenFlipperThread

    Instanciate this class in order to provide a thread
    to a plugin. Unless you don't need a specialized
    run() or cancel() function, it won't be necessary to
    reimplement this class. Just connect the signals
    for the thread to work properly.

    The following example shows a simple example
    of how to use this class from within a plugin:

\code
OpenFlipperThread* myThread = new OpenFlipperThread("MyPluginsThread");

// Connect the appropriate signals
connect(myThread, SIGNAL(state(QString, int)), this, SIGNAL(setJobState(QString, int)));
connect(myThread, SIGNAL(finished(QString)),   this, SIGNAL(finishJob(QString)));
connect(myThread, SIGNAL(function()),          this, SLOT(myPluginsThreadFunction()), Qt::DirectConnection);

// Tell core about my thread
emit startJob( "MyPluginsThread", "Thread Description" , 0 , 100 , true);

// Start internal QThread
myThread->start();

// Start actual processing of job
myThread->startProcessing();
\endcode
