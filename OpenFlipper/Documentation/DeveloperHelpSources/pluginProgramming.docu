 * \section plugin_sec Plugin Basics
 * 
 * As mentioned above OpenFlipper is a plugin based system. It uses the QT plugin implementation to
 * load and unload plugins at runtime. Every algorithm should be added as one of these plugins. 
 * 
 * The plugins have to be created as .so (or under windows : .dll) files which should be symlinked or 
 * copied to the Plugin sub folder. The cmake build system automatically places the plugins in the right folders
 * on all supported platforms. The Plugins are then loaded on startup of the core application
 * (they may also be loaded at runtime later).
 * 
 * \section plugin_prog_sec Plugin Programming
 * The interface between the core and the plugins is managed via simple interfaces based on the signal/slot
 * metaphor of QT. Your plugins have to be derived from these interfaces. You don't have to implement
 * all functions or signals of the interfaces you include. The BaseInterface has to be included in every
 * plugin. See the \ref baseInterfacePage "BaseInterface Documentation" for details.
 * 
 * Unimplemented functions will be left unconnected from the core and won't have any impact on the applications
 * speed or stability. As stated above, every plugin has to be derived from the BaseInterface. This is the
 * basic factory which makes the core aware of the plugin. The BaseInterface::name() and the
 * BaseInterface::description() of the plugin is exported via the BaseInterface. The initialization of each
 * plugin is done via this interface too.
 * See \ref baseInterfacePluginInitialization for an overview of OpenFlipper's startup and initialization calls.
 * 
 * After this interface of the plugin is successfully processed all other interfaces will be initialized
 * and connected to the core. For details about the individual interfaces see the
 * \ref interfaces "Plugin Interfaces Documentation".
 *
 * \section geometryData Handling geometry data within a plugin
 *
 * \subsection addingAndRemovingGeometry Adding and removing mesh objects in OpenFlipper
 *
 * If you want to load geometry data from a file or simply add objects to the scene
 * from within a plugin, it has to implement the \ref LoadSavePlugin.
 *
 * LoadSaveInterface::load(	QString _file, DataType _type, int&	_id) tries to
 * load file with file name _file of type _type, _id contains the new created
 * object's id or -1 if loading failed. OpenFlipper will then create all
 * the necessary scene graph nodes such that the developer generally does
 * not need to know in detail how to create and add the required nodes to the scene.
 *
 * Otherwise if a file has been loaded externally, slot
 *
 * LoadSaveInterface::openedFile (int _id) is called.
 *
 * When removing objects from the scene, the plugin simply has to emit signal
 *
 * LoadSaveInterface::deleteObject(int _id)
 *
 * or
 *
 * LoadSaveInterface::deleteAllObjects() in order to clear the scene.
 *
 * \subsection pluginFunctions OpenFlipper's plugin functions
 *
 * As a plugin in most cases operates on geometry data, developers might want to know how to gain access to mesh data
 * from within a plugin. In our tutorial \ref ex2 we roughly mentioned that the communication between OpenFlipper
 * and it's plugins is accomplished through either one of the provided \ref interfaces or the \ref PluginFunctions.
 *
 * For example iterating over all objects that have been marked as source objects is done via
 * 
 * <code>
 * for ( PluginFunctions::ObjectIterator o_it(PluginFunctions::SOURCE_OBJECTS);<br />
 * o_it != PluginFunctions::objectsEnd(); ++o_it) { ... }
 * </code>
 *
 * Possible restrictions are \c ALL_OBJECTS (to iterate over all objects in the scene), \c TARGET_OBJECTS (objects
 * that were marked as target) and \c SOURCE_OBJECTS.
 *
 * Another way to get handles to scene objects is to use the functions \c PluginFunctions::getObject() or
 * PluginFunctions::getPickedObject(). These functions provide a pointer to either a \ref BaseObjectData
 * or \ref BaseObject object. As in \ref ex2 one can easily test the type of an object by calling
 *
 * \c o_it->dataType(DATA_TYPE)
 *
 * where \c o_it is an object iterator and \c DATA_TYPE is one of the data types specified in \ref OpenFlipper/common/Types.hh.
 * \c o_it->dataType(DATA_TRIANGLE_MESH) for example will return true if the object is a triangle mesh.
 *
 * The mesh data itself can be obtained by calling the appropriate handle plugin function. For example if we consider
 * a triangle mesh, we get a handle to the mesh itself by calling
 *
 * <code>TriMesh* mesh = PluginFunctions::triMesh(*o_it);</code>
 *
 * where \c o_it once again is our object iterator. See \ref PluginFunctions for a complete overview.
 *
 * \subsection updatingObjects Updating objects
 *
 * Once your plugin has manipulated object data we have to inform OpenFlipper's core about the changes.
 * When doing this, OpenFlipper distinguishes between five basic types of changes:
 *
 * - Object selections
 * - Visibility
 * - Geometry
 * - Topology
 * - Selections (Vertices, Edges, Faces)
 *
 * When changing geometry, OpenFlipper's core will be forced to redraw the object that has been
 * changed by emitting signal
 *
 * \ref BaseInterface::updatedObject(int _id, UpdateType _type)
 *
 * where \c _id is the object's id and _type is the type of changes that have been made.
 * Note: UpdateType offers the following values
 *
 * - UPDATE_ALL
 * - UPDATE_OBJECT_SELECTION
 * - UPDATE_VISIBILITY
 * - UPDATE_GEOMETRY
 * - UPDATE_TOPOLOGY
 * - UPDATE_SELECTION (ALL THREE KINDS)
 * - UPDATE_SELECTION_VERTICES
 * - UPDATE_SELECTION_EDGES
 * - UPDATE_SELECTION_FACES
 * - UPDATE_UNUSED
 *
 * If the second parameter of this signal is not specified, it will fall back
 * to the default value UPDATE_ALL for compatibility reasons which actually updates
 * each of the types. Unless it is really necessary this should generally be avoided
 * since it consumes a lot of computation time.
 *
 * Additionally, when overriding the slot BaseInterface::slotObjectUpdated(int, const UpdateType),
 * a plugin receives the updated object's id (first parameter) and the type
 * of changes (second parameter).
 *
 * See \ref BaseInterface for more information.
 *
 * When changing object properties it won't be necessary to redraw the scene
 * since it can be expensive in computation power. In this case, one should emit
 *
 * \ref BaseInterface::objectPropertiesChanged(int _id)
 *
 * where \c _id once again is the object's id.
 *
 * If a plugin changed an object's visibility (hide, show), it should emit
 *
 * \ref BaseInterface::visibilityChanged(int _id)
 *
 * for the core to update the visibility state of object with identifier \c _id.
 *
 * Last, when changing an object's selection, it
 * will be updated by emitting
 *
 * \ref BaseInterface::objectSelectionChanged(int _id)
 *
 * where \c _id as in the examples above is the object's identifier.
 *
 * Also see \ref BaseInterface.
