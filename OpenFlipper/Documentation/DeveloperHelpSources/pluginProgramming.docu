 * \section plugin_sec Plugin Basics
 * 
 * As mentioned above OpenFlipper is a plugin based system. It uses the QT plugin implementation to
 * load and unload plugins at runtime. Every algorithm should be added as one of these plugins. 
 * 
 * The plugins have to be created as .so (or under windows : .dll) files which should be symlinked or 
 * copied to the Plugin sub folder. The cmake build system automatically places the plugins in the right folders
 * on all supported platforms. The Plugins are then loaded on startup of the core application
 * (they may also be loaded at runtime later).
 *
 * \section plugin_startup OpenFlipper Startup and Plugin Initialization
 * The plugins are initialized as shown in the following flow diagram:
 *
 * \image html OpenFlipperStartup.png 
 * 
 * Details of the startup process can be found here: \ref baseInterfacePluginInitialization
 *
 * \section plugin_prog_sec Plugin Programming
 * The interface between the core and the plugins is managed via simple interfaces based on the signal/slot
 * metaphor of QT. Your plugins have to be derived from these interfaces. You don't have to implement
 * all functions or signals of the interfaces you include. The BaseInterface has to be included in every
 * plugin. See the \ref baseInterfacePage "BaseInterface Documentation" for details.
 * 
 * Unimplemented functions will be left unconnected from the core and won't have any impact on the applications
 * speed or stability. As stated above, every plugin has to be derived from the BaseInterface. This is the
 * basic factory which makes the core aware of the plugin. The BaseInterface::name() and the
 * BaseInterface::description() of the plugin is exported via the BaseInterface. The initialization of each
 * plugin is done via this interface too.
 * See \ref baseInterfacePluginInitialization for an overview of OpenFlipper's startup and initialization calls.
 * 
 * After this interface of the plugin is successfully processed all other interfaces will be initialized
 * and connected to the core. For details about the individual interfaces see the
 * \ref interfaces "Plugin Interfaces Documentation".

 * \section plugin_prog_geometryData Handling geometry data within a plugin
 *
 * \subsection addingEmptyObjects Adding empty objects to the scene
 * To add empty objects to the scene, you have to use the LoadSaveInterface. The details are shown in the
 * following example: \ref adding_empty_objects.
 *
 * \subsection LoadingExistingObjects Loading data from files in OpenFlipper
 *
 * Usually the user loads existing data via the Load Entry in the File menu. Nevertheless it is possible
 * to load data from within a plugin( although it is not recommended).
 *
 * If you want to load geometry data from a file or simply add objects to the scene
 * from within a plugin, it has to implement the \ref loadSaveInterfacePage.
 *
 * LoadSaveInterface::load(	QString _file, DataType _type, int&	_id) tries to
 * load file with file name _file of type _type, _id contains the new created
 * object's id or -1 if loading failed. OpenFlipper will then create all
 * the necessary scene graph nodes such that the developer generally does
 * not need to know in detail how to create and add the required nodes to the scene.
 *
 * Otherwise if a file has been loaded externally, the slot LoadSaveInterface::openedFile (int _id) is called.
 *
 * \subsection RemovingObjectsFromScene Removing data from the scene
 * When removing objects from the scene, the plugin simply has to emit signal\n
 *  LoadSaveInterface::deleteObject(int _id)\n
 * or \n
 *  LoadSaveInterface::deleteAllObjects() in order to clear the scene.
 *
 * \subsection GettingObjectsFromScene Getting and enumerating objects in the scene
 *
 * Iterating over all objects is managed via the ObjectIterator.
 *
 * \code
 * for ( PluginFunctions::ObjectIterator o_it(PluginFunctions::SOURCE_OBJECTS);<br />
 * o_it != PluginFunctions::objectsEnd(); ++o_it) { ... }
 * \endcode
 * 
 * See \ref OpenFlipperIterators for details.
 *
 * Another way to get handles to scene objects is to use the functions \c PluginFunctions::getObject() or
 * PluginFunctions::getPickedObject(). These functions provide a pointer to either a \ref BaseObjectData
 * or \ref BaseObject object. As in \ref ex2 one can easily test the type of an object by calling:
 *
 * \code
 *   // If you have a BaseObjectData or BaseObject pointer
 *   DataType typeA =  object->dataType()
 *
 *   // with an object iterator
 *   DataType typeB =  o_it->dataType()
 * \endcode
 *
 * There are also boolean function where you can check for a specific type:
 *
 * \code
 *   // If you have a BaseObjectData or BaseObject pointer
 *   bool isTriangleMesh =  object->dataType(DATA_TRIANGLE_MESH)
 *
 *   // with an object iterator
 *   bool isPolyMesh =  o_it->dataType(DATA_POLY_MESH)
 * \endcode
 *
 *
 * The mesh data itself can be obtained by calling the appropriate handle plugin function. For example if we consider
 * a triangle mesh, we get a handle to the mesh itself by calling
 *
 * \code
 *   TriMesh* mesh = PluginFunctions::triMesh(*o_it);
 * \endcode
 *
 * See \ref PluginFunctions for a complete overview.
 *
 * \subsection pluginFunctions OpenFlipper's plugin functions
 *
 * As a plugin in most cases operates on geometry data, developers might want to know how to gain access to mesh data
 * from within a plugin. In our tutorial \ref ex2 we roughly mentioned that the communication between OpenFlipper
 * and it's plugins is accomplished through either one of the provided \ref interfaces or the \ref PluginFunctions.
 *
 * \section modifyingObjects Modifying Objects in OpenFlipper
 * In the previous section we got objects from OpenFlippers object management system. These objects directly contain
 * data in their original data structure (e.g. a pointer to an OpenMesh). In your plugin you can modify this data
 * directly in the data structure. For a mesh, you can for example add new faces or remove faces,... . After you modified
 * data, you have to inform OpenFlippers core system (and thereby the other plugins) what you did.
 *
 * This information system is implemented in the BaseInterface. Additional information can be found here: \ref baseInterfaceObjectUpdateNotification
 *
 * \section sceneUpdate Updating the current view
 * If you modified an object and informed the core that the object has changed, the scene will be automatically redrawn. A more detailed description
 * can be found in the BaseInterface: \ref baseInterfaceSceneUpdateNotification
