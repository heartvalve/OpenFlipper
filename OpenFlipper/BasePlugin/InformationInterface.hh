Click InformationInterface for a detailed overview of all provided slots
in the interface.

Derive from the information interface in order to provide information
on objects of a specific data type. To clarify this, we will give a short
example. Assuming we want to provide information on all mesh objects
(namely objects of type DATA_TRIANGLE_MESH and DATA_POLY_MESH).
In our plugin, we first have to override the slot that fetches the
supported data types:

\code
DataType MyInfoPlugin::supportedDataTypes() {

    return DataType(DATA_TRIANGLE_MESH | DATA_POLY_MESH);
}
\endcode

It's as simple as that. Now, each time an object is clicked in
identifier mode, slot slotInformationRequested() is called.
We ovveride this slot in order to do the actual picking
and displaying the gathered information in a dialog box:

\code
void MyInfoPlugin::slotInformationRequested(const QPoint _clickedPoint, const DataType _type) {

    // We only respond to requests for our data type
    if((_type != DATA_TRIANGLE_MESH) && (_type != DATA_POLY_MESH)) return;

    // Do the picking...

    // Display dialog box with all the information...
}
\endcode
