  * When using mouse events in your plugins implement this interface. Remember that
  * all plugins may get these signals. Therefore you hav to check if the current pickingMode
  * you want to react on is active before doing anything. Only the slotMouseEventIdentify is
  * independent of picking modes.
  *
  * The slotMouseWheelEvent and slotMouseEvent only get called when the system is in picking
  * mode.
  *
  * slotMouseEventIdentify will be used when question mode is active.

  * See our tutorial \ref ex3 for an example of how to use mouse and keyboard events
